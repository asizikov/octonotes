# OctoNotes
## A Release Notes Generator for GitHub Projects

A little side project specific to Octokit.NET which I'm developing in the open.

Yes, there are lots of these sorts of projects out there. This is one more.

## Why? 

As part of publishing each release of Octokit.NET, I sit down and craft up a set of release notes. This project is intended to replace much of the manual work that I do, and also simplify things by integrating with how the project is co-ordinated.

## What does it do?

Currently not much - just display a bunch of items associated with each merged PR from the time of the last release.

But check out [our discussion](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net/issues/1146) on the Octokit.NET about this to see what we're shooting for.
